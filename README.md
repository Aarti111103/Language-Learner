# 🌐 Language Learner – BCA Final Year Major Project
An AI-powered web application that enhances English language proficiency through grammar correction, multilingual translation, voice input, and vocabulary-building tools.
## 📘 Project Overview
Language Learner is an interactive and intelligent language improvement platform created as part of our Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA) final year major project under the guidance of Mr. Bhoopendra Singh, Assistant Professor at United University, Prayagraj.

This project was built by a team of four members with a shared vision to bridge the gap between traditional language learning and modern AI-driven tools. The platform uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Speech Recognition technologies to support grammar correction, translation, and vocabulary enhancement in real time.
